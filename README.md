# Circle Game
A simple 2D bullet dodging game. I'm not an advanced programmer and just learning so any advice would be greatly appreciated! Also English is not my native language so sorry if I make a mistake.

# How to install
- [Download](https://github.com/vDeresh/Circle_Game/archive/refs/heads/v1.1.zip) game files
- Extract files
- Run `python_64.bat` if you have 64-bit system or run `python_32.bat` if you have 32-bit system to install Python 3.10.9 (you can skip this step if you have already downloaded Python 3.10.9)
- Run `installer.bat`
## Windows can show warning after running .bat files but you can just click `More info` and then run it (you can check the files code if you want)

# How to play
- Simply run `start.pyw`
- Choose a [difficulty level](https://github.com/vDeresh/Circle_Game/wiki/Home/#difficulty-levels) and optional [special modes](https://github.com/vDeresh/Circle_Game/wiki#special-modes)
- Click `Play` button
